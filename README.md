## ❗ Problem

### 🧍‍♂️ Gambling is lonely and centralized

1. Popular platforms like **Stake** only let users play against the house.
2. There’s no way to play casino games **directly with friends**.
3. The **entire game logic and randomness** are controlled by a centralized backend.

### 🔍 Lack of transparency and control

## 🌟 Vision (Solution)

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social, Transparent, Decentralized Gambling

FriendzCasino offers a new model for online gambling:

- 🎯 **Room-based multiplayer games** where friends can bet and play together.
- 🔐 **Smart contracts enforce fairness** — no centralized control over outcomes or funds.
- 🎲 **Commit-reveal randomness** ensures that no one can tamper with the result.
- 💬 **Collaborative gameplay** builds trust and fun through shared experiences.
- 🌍 **On-chain integrity** guarantees transparency, immutability, and fairness in every game.

## 🎮 Available Game: Mines

### 💡 Game Flow

1. **Create a Room**
   - Go to the sidebar and click `Create Room`.
   - Enter a `roomId` and `betAmount`.

2. **Join the Room**
   - Players select the `Mines` game and join using the `roomId`.

3. **Place Bets**
   - Each joined player must place a bet to become an active participant.

4. **Start the Game**
   - Only the **room leader** can start the game.
   - The leader sets:
     - Number of **mines**
     - Number of **gems**

5. **Server Commits Random Mines**
   - On `GameStartedEvent`, the server:
     - Randomly generates mine positions.
     - Submits a **hash of the mines** to the Anchor program (not the actual positions yet).

6. **Players Submit Moves**
   - Players choose and submit cell positions.

7. **Reveal Mines**
   - Once all players have submitted, the **leader** triggers mine reveal.
   - The server sends the **actual mine positions**.
   - The smart contract:
     - Regenerates the hash from submitted positions.
     - Verifies it matches the earlier hash.

8. **Result & Payout**
   - ✅ If hash is valid:
     - Highest scorers (can be multiple) win.
     - Entire bet pool is split among winners.
   - ❌ If hash is invalid (e.g., tampering or server error):
     - All players get their bets refunded.

## 🔒 Security & Fairness
- Commit-Reveal Scheme
- Randomness is **off-chain generated** but **hash committed on-chain** for integrity.
- No player knows mine positions in advance.
- Smart contract **verifies hashes** before revealing results.
